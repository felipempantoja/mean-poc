# mean-poc [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/felipempantoja/mean-poc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/felipempantoja/mean-poc)

> POC using Mean Stack approach and based on the book
  called "[Mean](https://www.casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-mean)" from 
  the publisher Casa do Código.


## What is the Mean Stack?

Well, there's a lot of places on the internet explaining what it is, but in a nutshell, 
it's just a bunch of Javascript techonologies used to develop web applications, 
and nothing is cooler than using one single language to build things.

### But what about this acronym? MEAN? What's that MEAN (no pun intended)?

  * **M**ongoDB: Free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program
  * **E**xpress.js: Web application framework for Node.js
  * **A**ngular: Front-end web application framework mainly maintained by Google, 
    using SPA (Single-Page Application) principle 
  * **N**ode: Cross-platform built on Chrome's Javascript runtime for developing scalable network applications

### What else?
  * There's an integration to [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)

### TODO
  * Migrate to Angular 2 (or just Angular)
  * Integrate to Openshift (Red Hat's public cloud application)
  * Migrate do ES6 (AKA ES2015)
  * Maybe replace Grunt to Webpack?
